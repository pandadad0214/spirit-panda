# 🧱 Spirit Panda Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Spirit Panda sovereign AI node architecture.  
It describes the major components, how they interact, and the principles guiding the system’s design.

---

## 🌐 Core Principles

Spirit Panda is built on:

- **Local-first sovereignty** — runs on-device whenever possible  
- **Resilience** — self-healing patterns, watchdog logic, and modular design  
- **Expressive communication** — adaptive prosody and natural voice output  
- **Family-centric mentorship** — personalized, ethical, human-aligned behavior  
- **Transparency** — no black boxes, no hidden dependencies

## 🧩 Major Components

### **1. Termux AI Environment**
A clean, reproducible environment for running local AI models, scripts, and services.

Includes:
- Storage and permission patterns  
- Build-from-source workflows  
- Auto-start and watchdog logic  

---

### **2. Native Piper TTS Build**
A fully local speech engine built from source for Android.

Features:
- Custom voice models  
- Prosody control  
- Low-latency inference  

---

### **3. Adaptive Prosody Pipeline**
A research-backed system for expressive, natural speech.

Handles:
- Emotion shaping  
- Rhythm and pacing  
- Context-aware modulation  

---

### **4. Memory & File-Based Context System**
A transparent, inspectable memory layer that stores:
- Notes  
- Summaries  
- Reflections  
- User-defined knowledge  

---

### **5. Future Multi-Agent Federation**
A long-term vision where each family member has their own sovereign AI node.

Agents will:
- Collaborate  
- Balance each other  
- Share insights ethically  
- Maintain autonomy
