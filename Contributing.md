## 🧭 Core Principles

Before contributing, please understand the foundational philosophy:

- **Local‑first** — No cloud dependencies.  
- **Privacy‑respecting** — No telemetry, tracking, or data collection.  
- **Sovereign** — Users own their agents, their data, and their workflows.  
- **Readable** — Code should be clear, documented, and beginner‑friendly.  
- **Resilient** — Systems should fail gracefully and recover automatically.  

If your contribution aligns with these principles, you’re in the right place.
