# 🧩 Basic Spirit Panda Structure Example

This example shows a simple, high-level structure for a Spirit Panda node.  
It is not a full implementation — just a conceptual template to help others understand how the system is organized.

## 📁 Example Directory Layout

## 📝 Notes

- `core/` contains the main logic of the node  
- `memory/` stores summaries, reflections, and knowledge  
- `voice/` handles prosody and TTS configuration  
- `reasoning/` contains model prompts or logic modules  
- `config/` holds environment settings  
- `logs/` is for debugging and self-healing patterns  
- `models/` stores local AI models  
- `scripts/` contains helper tools and automation  

This example will expand as the project evolves.
